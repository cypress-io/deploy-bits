## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or above.

```sh
npm install --save @cypress/deploy-bits
```

## Use

### Debugging

To debug functions from this module, run the program with `DEBUG=deploy-bits` environment
variable.

### isCI

Returns `true` if the code is running on a common continuous integration server.
Uses [is-ci](https://github.com/watson/is-ci).

```js
const {isCI} = require(@cypress/deploy-bits)
if (isCI) {
  // we are on CI
}
```

### warnIfNotCI

Prints a console warning if the code is not running on CI. Often we prefer deploying
from CI rather than running the deploy command locally.

```js
const {warnIfNotCI} = require(@cypress/deploy-bits)
warnIfNotCI()
```

### getDeployEnvironment

Returns target deployment environment `staging` or `production`

```js
const {getDeployEnvironment} = require(@cypress/deploy-bits)
getDeployEnvironment()
  .then(env => ...)
```

If the user specified environment using CLI `--environment <name>` option, it will be used.
Otherwise, user will be prompted to select one.

```
? Which environment are you deploying? 
‚ùØ Staging 
  Production
```

You can pass list of arguments for this function to parse (by default it uses `process.argv`)
```js
getDeployEnvironment(['--environment', 'staging']) // yields "staging"
```
and you can even pass [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist) parsing options
```js
const options = {
  alias: {
    environment: 'e'
  }
}
getDeployEnvironment(['-e', 'staging']) // yields "staging"
```

### checkBranchEnvFolder

Checks the branch to environment mapping. For some branches checks if the working
directory is clean (no modified source files). Always returns input environment name.
Curried.

```js
const {checkBranchEnvFolder} = require(@cypress/deploy-bits)
checkBranchEnvFolder('master')('production')
// returns a promise resolved with "production"
// will throw an error if there are modified files
```

### getS3Config

Returns S3 config loaded from environment variable or local file. If cannot find either,
throws an error.

```js
const {getS3Config} = require(@cypress/deploy-bits)
const config = getS3Config()
```

Typical config file in `support/.aws-credentials.json` contains

```json
{
  "bucket-production": "<production S3 folder name>"
  "bucket-staging": "<staging S3 folder name>",
  "key": "AWS API key",
  "secret": "AWS API secret"
}
```
